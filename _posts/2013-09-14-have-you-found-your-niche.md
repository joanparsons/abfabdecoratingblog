title: "Have you found your niche?"

If you have found it, do you know what to do with it??  A niche can be a thing of beauty - not a blank void in a beautifully painted wall!! It is very simple to accomplish this look - the architectural elements are already there, with some paint and the following technique, it looks like it has been there for years!

I painted this basement (three rooms and a hallway) using three different colours on the same paint chip. This allows for colour flow. Some designers believe that using this technique - the rooms will all look the same colour. To the contrary, it depends on the natural and artificial light in the rooms being painted. I also find that using the light **and** darker end of the chip works well, as opposed to, for istance, the three at the lighter end. The variation works and the contrast of the colours flows nicely.

The photographs below are from beginning to end - once Brandon gets the photograph thing figured out, I can show you :-)
