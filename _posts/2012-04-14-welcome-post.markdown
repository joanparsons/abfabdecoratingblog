A gorgeous chic upholstered chair, or your fave comfy antique chair that belonged to your granny .....

Welcome to my blog. A little bit about me....I am a Brit, have lived in Canada for over 30 years, and am currently located in the Toronto area. I have been in the decorating and staging business for over 15 years and love everything about it! I have owned two interior decorating businesses - opened and managed a decorating/art store and look after my clients like they are family. 

My intention for this blog is to include all things decorating - inside, outside, colour, trends, books, tips, furniture, fabric, paint, old homes, new homes, esthetics, feng shui, my fave and inspirational things, trees, flowers and any other thing I can find relating to decor - inside and out. I want to help and inspire you too and most importantly, make sure you have FUN while learning something new! 

Now.... where is my latte ;-)Â  See you soon.....
