Enjoying Fall?? The colours are absolutely outstanding - but we know what happens after fall - there is only one colour worth mentioning - white!

I love colour – a LOT!!! It is my fave! Colour has a major impact on our emotions, moods and feelings causing dramatic physiological reactions, positive and negative. For that reason, there are many things to consider before picking up that gorgeous paint colour you saw in a magazine and then wonder why it does not look anything like the picture!

There are just so many colours in the paint store...... I have been told by a lot of my clients how overwhelming and frustrating it is walking into the store with colour chips in every imaginable colour! It is just too much to take in!  Typically, most people just turn around and walk out more frustrated than when they walked in! Do not despair - here are some tips to at least help you feel confident enough to make an informed decision - on a few chips at least!

Do not ask other people what they think!!!! Unless they are in the design business that is. Everyone has an opinion, and while they will try and help you, usually their choice is based on what they like or have in their own home - and trust me, it will look totally different in yours! AND you want to be original, so when people walk in they say - WOW!!

Before you even think about going to the paint store, you need a starting point. It is easy to get excited about your new project, rush out and pick a paint colour for no other reason than you love it!  Hold on a minute!  We need a beginning (where is the colour coming from), a middle (choosing the correct colour) and an end (the WOW!) to this story. Your colour has to come from something ..... anything in the room - draperies, rug, couch, even your art work.

In a perfect world, the best way to choose a colour is in natural sunlight....but sometimes that is not possible. The next best thing is to look at the colour in daylight and after the sun has gone down....you can then actually see what it will look like at different times and whether you truly like it. 

Other things to consider: the colour of your floors, which way the room faces - if you paint the same colour in a north and south facing room, they will look totally different! Lighting in the room is also another biggie - how much natural light does the room get?? The wattage and colour of your bulbs (cool blue - warm orange) can also alter the colour!

I know there is a lot to consider but it is definitely worth it to get your WOW result. My next blog will have information on different colours and how they actually make you feel and react!!

Now, where is my paint brush :-)  Till next time.....happy painting!
