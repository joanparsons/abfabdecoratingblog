I cannot believe it .... summer is almost over and fall is just around the corner, already??!!  The evenings are turning chilly, the leaves are beginning to fall and that nip is in the air. 

It is a great time to prepare your garden for winter.  It will not only look better but will make it so much easier in the spring when you are itching to get out there and dig!  

Don't forget - remove dead plants; mulch your flower beds; plant spring bulbs; give everything a good water before the ground freezes and clean and store your tools properly.

The outside of your home does not have to look drab and dull in the fall and winter. Right now, you can inject some colour outside on your porch with gorgeous pots of mums and seasonal flowering plants. 

As well as colour, scale and form in your garden, consider the many creative lighting solutions available. It is not only a safety factor but will enhance the look of your garden any time of the year. Landscaping and lighting provide that very important 'first impression' of your home (especially if you are selling).  Make it count!!

Our focus will soon shift from the outdoors to the indoors. This is one of my busiest times of the year…… everyone has spent so much time building that awesome deck and planting absolutely fabulous perennials and shrubs, it is now time to start to think about cozying up your home for the winter months.

It can be as simple as changing up a few fabrics (curtains, pillows and throws) or maybe a different paint colour in your favourite room – a lovely caramel colour to add warmth to your space? Perfect for curling up with a great book.Mmmmm…this is a great time of year for hot chocolate – with marshmallows of course. What a great idea!!!  Stay tuned.
